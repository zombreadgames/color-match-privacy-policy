    <div>
      <p class="bold">Effective Date:</span> August 17, 2025.</p>
      <p class="bold">Last Updated:</span> August 17, 2025.</p>

      <p class="bold" style="margin-top: 24px;">1. What data we collect</p>
      <p>When you sign in with Google Play Games, we may receive only your public profile information provided by Google:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Google Play Games ID</span> (unique identifier)</li>
        <li>Public <span class="bold">display name</span> (nickname)</li>
        <li>Public <span class="bold">profile image</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From these, we <span class="bold">only use and store your Google Play Games ID</span> to create and manage your player account.
        Your public name and image are not required for gameplay and are not stored in our database.
      </p>

      <p class="bold" style="margin-top: 24px;">2. Game data & retention</p>
      <p>
        Your game data (e.g., progress, settings, items) is saved in our database and linked to your Google Play Games ID.
        We keep this data <span class="bold">until you request deletion</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="bold" style="margin-top: 24px;">3. How to request account & data deletion</p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">In-app (recommended):</span> open the <span class="bold">User Profile</span> screen (the same screen where you change your nickname) and tap the
        <span class="bold">trash icon button</span> located on the right side of the menu on that screen. Follow the confirmation prompts to permanently delete your account and data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once deletion is complete, your player account and all game data linked to your Google Play Games ID will be permanently removed and cannot be recovered. This includes your progress, items, and any purchases or paid entitlements associated with the account. Proceed with caution.
      </p>

      <p class="bold" style="margin-top: 24px;">4. Irreversibility</p>
      <p>
        Deletion is permanent. If you play again after deletion, a new account may be created when you sign in with Google Play Games.
      </p>
